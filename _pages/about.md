I am a ML Research Associate at Adobe Systems, working in the **Media and Data Science Research (MDSR) Lab** on human behavior modeling using large language and vision models (LLMs/VLMs). My research focuses on predicting, optimizing, and explaining human behavior in real-world contexts, particularly at the intersection of multimodal learning and computational social science. At Adobe, I work with [Yaman Kumar Singla](https://sites.google.com/view/yaman-kumar/) and [Balaji Krishnamurthy](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=n8iUBg8AAAAJ&hl=en).

I completed my B.Tech (Hons.) in Computer Science & Engineering with a Minor in Economics from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) in 2023, graduating with a CGPA of 9.49/10.0. During my undergraduate studies, I was consistently recognized on the Dean's List of Academic Excellence for three consecutive years.

My research interests span **Natural Language Processing**, **Computer Vision**, **Behavioral Science**, and **Graph Learning**. I have published papers at top-tier conferences including ICLR, EACL, NAACL, and WACV, and have filed multiple patents for my work on synthetic gaze generation and multimodal content understanding.

During my undergraduate studies, I completed my Bachelor's thesis on *"LearnAd: Multi-modal Fusion Transformer for Understanding Digital Advertisements"* advised by [Prof. Rajiv Ratn Shah](https://midas.iiitd.ac.in/) at MIDAS Lab, IIIT Delhi. I have also worked with [Prof. Mukesh Mohania](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zgaqvNQAAAAJ&hl=en) on developing a *"Multi-Relational Graph Transformer for Automatic Short Answer Grading"*.

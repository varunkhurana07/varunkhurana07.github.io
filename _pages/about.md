I am a ML Research Associate at Adobe Systems, working on human behavior modeling using large language and vision models (LLMs/VLMs). My research focuses on predicting, optimizing, and explaining human behavior in real-world contexts, particularly at the intersection of multimodal learning and computational social science.

I completed my B.Tech (Hons.) in Computer Science & Engineering with a Minor in Economics from [IIIT Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/) in 2023, graduating with a CGPA of 9.49/10.0. During my undergraduate studies, I was consistently recognized on the Dean's List of Academic Excellence for three consecutive years.

My research interests span **Natural Language Processing**, **Computer Vision**, **Behavioral Science**, and **Graph Learning**. I have published papers at top-tier conferences including ICLR, EACL, NAACL, and WACV, and have filed multiple patents for my work on synthetic gaze generation and multimodal content understanding.

Before joining Adobe full-time, I completed research internships at Adobe's Media and Data Science Research Lab, IIIT Delhi, and MIDAS Lab, where I worked on diverse problems ranging from automatic short answer grading to advertisement understanding and synthetic human gaze generation.
